QUADRATIC EQUATIONS

c is the y value where x = 0
b is the linear term. In our case, time goes down linearly as we hold the button longer
a is the quadratic term. Our speed goes up by a quadratic amount as we hold the button longer

In a quadratic equation, x is the unknown value
In our situation, this is a bit unintuitive, because what we want to find is the speed,
   which should be the quadratic term, so let's work it in a roundabout way

For our application:

let c = distance traveled
let b = time travelled
let x = how long we held the button

(b - x) * x = c

This factors to:

bx - x^2 = c

Now let's re-arrange it a bit

-x^2 + bx = c
-x^2 + bx - c = 0

We almost have a quadratic equation
Since the first x cannot arbitrarily be negative, we can say that a = -1

Now we can plug this into the quadratic formuala in order to get the points of x that are
greater than zero, meaning our final result will be greater than the record
