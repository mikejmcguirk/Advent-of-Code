collapse ranges?

iterate one seed at a time, this way, once the seed is updated, we can advance to
the next category. this removes the need for the bookkeeping array, and we can use splits
more easily

use negative numbers to indicate that a seed is updated

we should be able to call each split recursively without having to recollect them. waste

can we do intersections based off of ranges?

You don't actually even need recursion because you just hold
the good range and the bad range line to line
